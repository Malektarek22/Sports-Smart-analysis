# Sports-Smart-analysis
is a software application that uses video recordings to analyse sports 
performance. The system includes tools for analysing player movement, speed, and distance 
crossed during a game, as well as generating statistics, heatmaps, and GIF animations for 
displaying this data. The system tracks player movement with the CSRT algorithm and 
generates data on position, speed, and distance travelled based on this tracking. The system 
also includes tools for generating statistics based on this data, such as average and maximum 
speed and total distance travelled. Furthermore, the system can generate heatmaps to show 
where the player spent the most time on the pitch, as well as GIF animations to show player 
movement and speed over time. Overall, the Sports System offers a powerful set of tools for 
analysing sports performance using video recordings, which can be used by coaches, trainers, 
and athletes to improve their performance and gain insights into their game.
